# Command lines for building Adobe NotDef
#
# Version 2016-05-23
#
# The following AFDKO "makeotf" command line builds the OpenType/CFF
# font:

makeotf -f cidfont.ps -omitMacNames -ff features -fi cidfontinfo -mf FontMenuNameDB -r -stubCmap4 -ch UnicodeAll-UTF32-H

# Note that the 'VORG', 'vhea', and 'vmtx' table can be safely purged,
# and to add the "stub" 'DSIG' table to the OpenType/CFF font, the
# following AFDKO command lines are used:

sfntedit -d VORG,vhea,vmtx AND-Regular.otf
sfntedit -a DSIG=DSIG.bin AND-Regular.otf
sfntedit -f AND-Regular.otf

# For those who want to replace the glyph with one of their own
# design, the source name-keyed Type 1 font, font.pfa, is supplied as
# an example, along with the AFDKO "mergeFonts" mapping file, map.txt,
# that is used to map the glyph to CIDs 0 through 2048 to create the
# source CIDFont resource. The following is the "mergeFonts" command
# line:

mergeFonts -cid cidfontinfo cidfont.ps map.txt font.pfa

# EOF
